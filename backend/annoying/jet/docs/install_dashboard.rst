Dashboard Installation
======================

.. note::
    Dashboard is located into a separate application. So after a typical JET installation it won't be active.
    To enable dashboard application follow these steps:

* Add 'jet.dashboard' application to the INSTALLED_APPS setting of your Django project settings.py file (note it should be before 'jet'):

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'jet.dashboard',
        'jet',
        'django.contrib.admin',
        ...
    )

* Add URL-pattern to the urlpatterns of your Django project urls.py file (they are needed for relatedâ€“lookups and autocompletes):

.. code:: python

    urlpatterns = patterns(
        '',
        url(r'^jet/', include('jet.urls', 'jet')),  # Django JET URLS
        url(r'^jet/dashboard/', include('jet.dashboard.urls', 'jet-dashboard')),  # Django JET dashboard URLS
        url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        ...
    )

* **For Google Analytics widgets only** install python package:

.. code::

    pip install google-api-python-client==1.4.1

* Create database tables:

.. code:: python

    python manage.py migrate dashboard
    # or
    python manage.py syncdb

* Collect static if you are in production environment:

.. code:: python

        python manage.py collectstatic
